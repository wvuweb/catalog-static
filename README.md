### Lint your code

This repo comes with both an EditorConfig file and SCSS Lint file. Before making any modifications, consider installing [EditorConfig](https://editorconfig.org/#download) and [scss-lint](https://github.com/brigade/scss-lint/#installation).

### Getting Started with Gulp

Travis Maynard wrote [a great article](http://www.travismaynard.com/writing/getting-started-with-gulp) about how to get started with Gulp. I've already done the heavy lifting with Gulp by creating the `gulpfile.js`, but that article brings it back to the basics to help you get started.

If the dependencies in this project are old and you want to update your packages, follow [these instructions](http://stackoverflow.com/a/16074029/4032506).

## About Catalog.wvu.edu

WVU's course catalog is run and hosted by a third-party vendor called [CourseLeaf](https://www.courseleaf.com/). The [WVU Registrar](https://registrar.wvu.edu) is in charge of the content while CourseLeaf handles the technical implementation (hosting, templating, support, etc).

## About this template

This is a flat HTML template which uses styles from WVU's pattern library, [Supertheme](https://supertheme.sandbox.wvu.edu). Supertheme was built for [CleanSlate CMS](https://cleanslatecms.wvu.edu), WVU's mutli-site content management system. This template has abstracted the HTML from CleanSlate Radius Templates to flat, vanilla HTML. You could easily use this template to wrap any app or service with WVU branding. There's a psuedo "style-guide" in the tabs of this HTML file. You can also see more options on the [Supertheme website](https://supertheme.sandbox.wvu.edu).

This theme uses [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/) and Gulp to compile the CSS. I have specifically commented out various partials in `scss/1-base/base-dir.scss` and `scss/2-modules/modules-dir.scss` because Catalog didn't use those patterns (performance!). If you want to use some of the commented out patterns (maybe you need two, three or four column stuff), follow the install instructions, run `gulp` and uncomment the requisite Sass partials.
